# malagasy-data
## Malagasy analysis ruby implementation

## Running
```
ruby malagasy.rb
```

##Output
The script will run and generate the results it finds in "results.txt".

## Implementation
The word list themselves are made into their underlying stems. The functions
that represent each rule are applied in the order they should be specified
so that the forms are representative of the analysis.
